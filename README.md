# What's this?

This is just a repository holding the Snakefile and Dockerfile to generate [vidjil](https://www.vidjil.org/) results from a Fastq folder.
In the release section is the tar file for the docker image I built.

Please visit [vidjil](https://www.vidjil.org/) website if you want to know more.
I'm not a vidjil developer, this is just a convenience pipeline for other bioinformaticians like me.

Enjoy!

# Get this pipeline
